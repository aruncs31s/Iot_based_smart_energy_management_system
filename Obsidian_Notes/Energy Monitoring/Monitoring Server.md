  #Requirements

1. [[Projects/Iot_based_smart_energy_management_system/Obsidian_Notes/ESP32/esp32|esp32]]

`ThingSpeak` allows you to publish your sensor readings to their website and plot them in charts with timestamps.

#### Setup

> 1.  Installing the ThingSpeak Library
> 2.  [Go to ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) an click the “**Get Started For Free**” button to create a new account. This account is linked to a Mathworks account. So, if you already have a Mathworks account, you should log in with that account
> 3.  Creating New Channel

    1. After your account is ready, sign in, open the “**Channels**” tab and select “**My Channels**“.
    2. Type a name for your channel and add a description. In this example, we’ll just publish temperature. If you want to publish multiple readings (like humidity and pressure), you can enable more fields later

> 4.  Customizing Chart

    - The chart can be customized, go to your **Private View** tab and click on the edit icon.

> 5.  API Key
> 6.  To send values from the ESP32 to ThingSpeak, you need the Write API Key. Open the “**API Keys**” and copy the key

#requiredLibraries

- `ThingSpeak.h`

- Initialize the The thinkspeak Client `ThingSpeak.begin(client);` inside the `void setup()`

#imporatant

```c
unsigned long myChannelNumber = X;
const char * myWriteAPIKey = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";

int x = ThingSpeak.writeField(myChannelNumber, 1, temperatureC, myWriteAPIKey);

```
